# Monarch Migration Tagging and Reporting
*Data Analysis and Visualization*

#### Arink Bertrand

In this project I gathered Monarch Tagging and Reporting data from MonarchWatch.org. for 1994-2001. My goal is to get insight on how many Monarch butterflies are tagged compared to those reported, travel patterns and compare to news articles as to why report numbers dropped. I plan to use plot.ly and Power BI for visualization.


### Steps to Accomplish:

1. Import all necessary packages
2. Use tabula.app to convert pdf data to csv
3. Database cleanup for each year individually
4. Create Monarch Migration database
5.
