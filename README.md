# Monarch Migration Tagging and Reporting
*Data Analysis and Visualization*

#### Arink Bertrand

In this project I gathered Monarch Tagging and Reporting data from MonarchWatch.org. for 1994-2001. My goal is to get insight on how many Monarch butterflies are tagged compared to those reported, travel patterns and compare to news articles as to why report numbers dropped. I plan to use plot.ly and Power BI for visualization.


### Steps to Accomplish:

- [x] Create ReadMe file to explain plan 
- [ ] Import all necessary packages
- [ ] Use tabula.app to convert pdf data to csv
- [ ] Database cleanup for each year individually
- [ ] Create Monarch Migration database
- [ ] Use SQL and pandas to aggregate data
- [ ] Visualize travel and numbers using plot.ly and Power BI
- [ ] Update ReadMe to futher explain varifications, language etc.
