# Monarch Migration Tagging and Reporting
*Data Analysis and Visualization*

#### Arink Bertrand

In this project, I gathered Monarch Tagging and Reporting data from MonarchWatch.org. for 1994-2001. My goal is to get insight on how many Monarch butterflies are tagged compared to those reported, travel patterns and compare to news articles as to why report numbers dropped. I plan to use plot.ly and Power BI for visualization.

### Steps to Accomplish:

- [x] Create ReadMe file to explain plan 
- [x] Import all necessary packages
- [x] Use tabula.app to convert pdf data to csv
- [x] Database cleanup & export to csv for each year individually
- [x] Create Monarch Migration database
- [x] Use SQL and pandas to aggregate data
- [x] Visualize travel and numbers using plot.ly and Power BI
- [x] Update ReadMe to futher explain varifications, language etc.

### Dependencies

- SQLite3
- Pandas
- Plot.ly
- Microsoft Power BI
